## 2. Licensing & Commercial Rights

To keep this project sustainable and allow for potential Steam releases, we use a slightly modified contribution model. By submitting a Pull Request, you agree to the following:

### 2.1 You Keep Your Copyright
You remain the owner of your code. You are simply giving us permission to use it.

### 2.2 Grant of Unlimited License
You grant the Project Maintainer a permanent, worldwide, and royalty-free license to use your contribution. This includes the right to:
* Distribute it under the current open-source license (GPLv3).
* Include it in future proprietary or commercial versions (e.g., a "Pro" version on Steam).
* Sublicense or modify the code as needed for technical compatibility.

### 2.3 Why we need this?
This ensures that the project can evolve without legal deadlocks. It allows us to protect the codebase and potentially monetize parts of the tool to cover development costs (servers, certificates, etc.) without having to ask for permission retroactively.

> **In short:** You help the community today, and you give us permission to keep the project alive (and maybe sell a coffee-money version) tomorrow.
